# Loan Eligibility Model Solution

Project Overview
This project establishes a robust machine learning model to predict loan eligibility for applicants using the German Credit dataset. This dataset encompasses details of 614 applicants, including 13 attributes and a binary classification indicating whether a loan was granted or denied.

File Structure
The project is meticulously organized to promote clarity and maintainability:

data/: Houses the data files essential for analysis.

mall_customers.csv: This file contains the primary dataset for loan applicant information.
logs/: Serves as a repository for capturing application activity.

mall_customer_segmentation.log: This log file diligently tracks actions pertaining to loan eligibility predictions.
src/: Encapsulates the core source code modules that drive the project's functionality.

init.py: This initialization file is crucial for ensuring the src directory is recognized as a Python package.
clustering.py: (Optional) If your project includes clustering tasks, this file would store associated functions.
data_preparation.py: This module effectively handles data loading, preprocessing, and cleaning operations.
visualization.py: This module provides an arsenal of functions for visually exploring the data and presenting results in an informative manner.
main.py: The central script that orchestrates the entire project execution.
requirements.txt: This plain text file meticulously specifies all external Python libraries necessary for the project to function seamlessly.
